My master studies was about using computational chemistry method (DFT and MD) to understand and describe gelation behavior. After graduation, I joined in Origin Quantum company as a quantum algorithm developer, where my research interest is about optimization and application of variational quantum algorithm. 

In this website I put some of notes and code about quantum chemistry and quantum computing I'm interested in. (I used to put it in my personal blog in Chinese, now I translate and organize them on Github pages.) This website is still under construction, I will keep it up to date as much as I can. 

Some code might seem basic and just in a few lines, but they provide some insights before starting to do new projects . I consider these code snippets as a verified toolbox, where all the scripts has been validated through prior project implementations. (LLM can generate code but it can never replace my working experience gained by debugging trauma :laughing:)
